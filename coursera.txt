I am a  student of an engineering college which fee is around 4 lakh(around 6240 dollars)
 for the full course. I have taken a loan from a bank for this course.
 I can't pay for this course. My father died in October.
 So My family can't afford for this course.
 I am an IT student and I am very much interested in this course.
 Andrew sir is one of the best machine learning teacher and expert in this universe.
  I have seen his Stanford University lecture on youtube.It is good.
  You can easily understand.That's why I want to take this course.
  I know that this course is worthy but I can't afford this course if this financial aid is not available.
  Thanks to coursera for giving us the opportunity to take this course free.

thank you
